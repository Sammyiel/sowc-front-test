        <p class="text-justify">
            The School of Wildlife Conservation (SOWC) is the conservation initiative of the African Leadership Group. It was established in 2016 to promote conservation as an African growth sector by developing the next generation of entrepreneurial conservation
            leaders at all levels, through undergraduate, middle management, and executive programmes. In combining innovative research and leadership talent cultivation, SOWC encourages entrepreneurship within the wildlife economy and provides a platform
            for young entrepreneurs to incubate their innovative conservation business models. At a macro level, SOWC seeks to influence the sector’s decision-makers to adopt sustainable business models and promote an entrepreneurial business-minded approach
            in African conservation.

            <h4>About the SOWC research programme</h4>
        </p>
        <p>Our mission is to promote a growing, inclusive, sustainable wildlife economy in Africa</p>

        <p>
            The aim of our research is to gather data and information to illustrate the value of wildlife to economies and through this to encourage investment in this important economic asset. The research process also highlights data gaps and we hope that it stimulates
            the collection of data related to wildlife economies in order to better understand the vast contribution of wildlife resources to local, national and regional economies.

        <p class="text-justify">
            While conducting the research for the State of the Wildlife Economy in Africa report the School of Wildlife Conservation (SOWC) collected and analysed data from numerous different sources and covering many different wildlife economy topics. This database
            includes a list of these references to allow for easy searching and locating relevant references for those interested in the wildlife economy in Africa. The database will be updated regularly and we encourage you to also share your own and
            other resources which we can add to keep the database up-to-date. Please email Dr Sue Snyman, Director of Research – sowc-research@alueducation.com any resources to add or to give us feedback on the database.
